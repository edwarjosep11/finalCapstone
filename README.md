# Final Capstone Projects HyperionDev

This repository contains three data science projects:

1. Analysis of Income and Balance: In this project, I analyzed the relationship between income and balance of bank customers, using exploratory data analysis techniques and machine learning models to predict whether a customer will have a high balance based on their income.

2. Insurance Prediction: In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will claim insurance or not, using various demographic and lifestyle features.

3. Movie Description Similarity: In this project, I used natural language processing techniques to find the most similar movie to a given description, using the spaCy library and a pre-trained English language model.

## Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* Project 1: Analysis of Income and Balance
* Project 2: Insurance Prediction
* Project 3: Movie Description Similarity

## Installation
To run these projects on your local machine, you will need to install Python 3 and the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly
* spacy

Or you can install directly using the following snippet:
* `pip install requirements.txt`

## Usage 
To run each project, navigate to the project folder and run the Python file associated with that project. For example, to run the Analysis of Income and Balance project, navigate to the Analysis of Income and Balance folder and run the income_balance.py file.

Each project includes a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the project and interpret the results.

### Project 1: Analysis of Income and Balance
The Analysis of Income and Balance project contains the following files:

* income_balance.py: The main Python script that performs exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling.
* bank.csv: The dataset used in this project.
* README.md: Detailed instructions on how to run the project and interpret the results.


### Project 2: Insurance Prediction
The Insurance Prediction project contains the following files:

* insurance.py: The main Python script that builds a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will claim insurance or not.
* insurance.csv: The dataset used in this project.
* README.md: Detailed instructions on how to run the project and interpret the results.

###Project 3: Movie Description Similarity
* The Movie Description Similarity project contains the following files:
* movie_similarity.py: The main Python script that finds the most similar movie to a given description using natural language processing techniques.
* movies.txt: The dataset used in this project.
* README.md: Detailed instructions on how to run the project and interpret the results.
